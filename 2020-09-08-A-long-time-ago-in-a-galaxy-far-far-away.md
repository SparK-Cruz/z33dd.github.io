Hello, I'm Z33DD

As this is officially the fist post of this site, I want to write something more cool that "Hello World". So why not the [fist words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_opening_crawl) of my favorite movies saga?&nbsp;

Let me introduce myself: I'm a dev based on Brazil and I love 0's and 1's since when I didn't even know what they had to do with that screen and keyboard where I surfed on Wikipedia. When I was 5, my dad started teaching me how to use that strange invention that he spends so much time in front of. At first I was introduced to Mr. Google, the best teacher of my whole life. OK, it's more like that strange teacher that stalks the students but was what I have before meet [the duck](https://duckduckgo.com/).

My childhood with overprotective parents made me go on as a geek watching the Discovery and History Channel. When the class was boring, I spent my time reading science books and when it was physical education class, I always ran away to the library to play chess, read a book or even watch a documentary about Einstein's life. Another thing I discovered in my childhood was Star Wars and other science fiction films. These works were what sparked my love for technology and the desire to change the world using it. Think about it: every sci-fi work comes down to a smart protagonist doing the right thing by fucking awesome technology, be it a lightsaber, a cool spaceship or maybe some funny robot. And there's also the intelligence factor, no stupid protagonist lasts long on screen, _unless it's [Jar Jar Binks](https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/charmed-episodes-shannen-doherty-directed.html/)..._

Going back to the story, as a teenager I already had my first console: the Xbox 360. I spent good hours playing [Halo: Reach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo%3A_Reach) in PvP against my younger brother. When I got my first laptop, a curiosity started to push me beyond chess and The Sims. Curiosity moves me in a way that I can't explain and I love it. Sometimes I make some mistakes, like formatting an important hard drive accidentally, but in general it does much better than this type of accident.&nbsp;It turned out that with this accident I had to learn how to recover files.

My first programming language was Python and my first Linux distribution for Ubuntu 14, I remember that I almost had an orgasm when I saw the purple boot screen for the first time. Today I use Arch [btw](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-btw-I-use-arch).


My political view can be resumed in a phrase:&nbsp;
> _I want gay couples to be able to defend their marijuana farms with guns (and tanks, maybe)_

I view myself as a free-market anarchist like [Tim C. May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_C._May).&nbsp;

Let's clarify some things:

- No, I'm not some kid of far-right extremist who want to jail everyone who disagree with me,[ quite the opposite](https://www.libertarianism.org/topics/freedom-speech).

- No, I'm not a racist or scientific racism advocate like&nbsp;[Stefan Molyneux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Molyneux)&nbsp;by any reason.

- Yes, I believe that vacines works.&nbsp;&nbsp;

- No, I'm not affiliate to the Libertarian Party or another party, using the government to end the government does not seem efficient.

And, finally, I'm not the spokesman of the Libertarian cause, so I don't run daily life around my political orientation and I not the best people to explain you every nuance of a libertarian society.

Actually I'm part of the Brazilian cypherpunk movement. We are a decentralized collective of individuals, in majority libertarians too, that discuss and broadcast the usage of technology and cryptology to reduce the powers of the state against peaceful people. Our You can read more at the [official site](https://cypherpunks.com.br/)&nbsp;in portuguese.

I start writing this to share my thinks with some random guys who can understand my poorly english and maybe know more people outside the world. Here you can expect me writing about technical stuff, decentralized technology, open source software and hardware, my views about what happens in the world and commentaries about whatever I want.

Be welcome!
